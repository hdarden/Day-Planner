# Day-Planner

Using JQuery and html I created a day planner to keep track of a to do list for each hour of the day between 9AM-5PM. This planner has the date and time and the current hour displayed at the top of the page. Each hour is time-blocked and has an input field for the user to store a to do, and a save button. When the save button is clicked the item is inputted into the localStorage, keeping track of the user's (to do) until the item is cleared out by the user.
